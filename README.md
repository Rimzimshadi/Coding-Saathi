Task #01: Music Recommendation System
Problem Statement: Music recommender systems can suggest songs to users based on their listening pattern. 
During this phase, I engaged with Python functions that are pivotal in the domain of data analysis:
I effectively employed these functions to derive essential summary statistics for the designated dataset.

Task #02: Image to pencil sketch with Python
Problem Statement: 
We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.

Task #03 Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
Problem Statement: As a security/defence analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. It's a pressing issue with far-reaching consequences. Initially, the data is cleaned, then nulls and duplicates are found and replaced with appropriate data. Then analysis is done and attacks, casualties, number of people killed and wounded are found basis year, region, country, city, terrorist group, attack type, target type, group and country wise attack and humanity affected worldwide by these attacks from 1970-2017.

Task #04: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
Problem Statement: 
Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
